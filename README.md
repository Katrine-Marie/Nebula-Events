# Nebula Events
A Wordpress plugin to handle event creation and management.

## How It Works
This plugin lets you create Events in your Wordpress dashboard, as you would with Posts. You can add Event location, time etc., as well as the hosts information for each event.

The list of events allows you to filter by event name or date.

You can add the list of events to the menu on your site, and display the events as a blog page on your site. 
Also, you have several options in terms of how to show the single event page. You can choose the template of your choice on the plugin's options page.
